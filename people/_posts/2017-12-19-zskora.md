PhD student at the Institute of Psychology, Jagiellonian University.

My research concentrates on the influence of selective attention on the quality and subjective accessibility of short-term memory and working memory.

Research interests:
* the retro-cue benefit
* relationship between memory & consciousness
* bayesian approach to data analysis
* open science
