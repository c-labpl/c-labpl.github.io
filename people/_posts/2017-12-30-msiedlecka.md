Assistant Professor at the Institute of Psychology, Jagiellonian University.

I am mainly interested in metacognition and how metacognitive feelings arise.

Research interests:
– subjective measures of consciousness
– metacognitive awareness
– the role of emotion in metacognition
– bodily awareness
