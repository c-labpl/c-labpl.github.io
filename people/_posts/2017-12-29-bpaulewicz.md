Assistant Professor at the Institute of Psychology, Jagiellonian University.

Most of the time I’m preoccupied by two meta-theoretical issues, one is the relation between the mechanism identification problem and the task identification problem in cognitive psychology and the other is the relation between mechanistic and teleological descriptions of a purposeful system. Consciousness interests me because I have no idea what its function is and because I find the psychometric issues involved in studying it quite puzzling.

Research interests:
* meta-theoretical foundations of cognitive psychology
* modern (bayesian, AIT, robust) statistical methods and causal analysis (a la Pearl)
* measures of consciousness
