The most effective PhD student at C-Lab.  
I graduated from Cognitive Science (BA & MA) and Computer Mathematics (BA) at the Jagiellonian University. Since joining C-lab in 2017, I have worked with MRI data.  
Currently, I am finalising my PhD project under the supervision of Prof. Michał Wierzchoń (Jagiellonian University) and Dr. Kristian Sandberg (Aarhus University). My dissertation focuses on the neural substrates of perceptual processing and metacognition, emphasising functional networks studied through resting-state fMRI.  
I am interested in various aspects of MRI data, including technical nuances, preprocessing strategies, and connectivity analysis. I enjoy resting-state paradigms and network perspectives, while also exploring other imaging modalities, such as diffusion imaging or structural MRI.
