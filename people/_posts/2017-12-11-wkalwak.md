PhD student at the Institute of Psychology, Jagiellonian University.

My scientific interest is human experience of any kind but especially our scientific ways of acknowledge it. I’m trying to convince experimental researchers to use qualitative methodology.

Research interests:
– philosophy and methodology of science
– philosophy of mind (philosophy of mental health)
– phenomenology
– medical humanities
