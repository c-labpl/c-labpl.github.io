PhD student at Behavioural and Social Neuroscience research group, Central European Institute of Technology (CEITEC)

My research focuses on the neurophenomenal aspects of voluntary agency (awareness of intention) and sense of agency in healthy people and patients. I am also interested in methodological pitfalls of reporting in agency research and generally in methodology of consciousness research. As a part of the ongoing collaboration with C-Lab we are investigating influence of Sense of Agency on implicit perception of spatial relationship (spatial binding). Another line of research explores a role of predictive coding in interoception on experience of agency.

Research interests:
– awareness of intention
– sense of agency
– measures of agency
– intentional binding
– predictive coding
