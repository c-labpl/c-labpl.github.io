PhD student at the Institute of Psychology, Jagiellonian University.

Currently, my research is focused on 1) the influence of subliminal stimuli on decision making and 2) the methodology of subliminal perception research. The goal of my PhD project is to delineate the limits of the influence of unconscious stimuli on decisions and reasoning.

I am also interested in many other scientific and philosophical aspects of consciousness, such as the hard problem of consciousness (why do we have consciousness?), the explanatory gap (how it is possible that a piece of meat inside our heads generates phenomenal experiences?), evolution of consciousness (does consciousness exist since the beginning of life?), or AI consciousness (can we create conscious minds? have we already created them?).

Research interests:
* unconscious perception
* critical arguments against unconscious perception
* EEG
* philosophy of mind
* philosophy of science
