Post-doc at the Institute of Psychology, Jagiellonian University.

Before joining the C-Lab, I completed a BBSRC-funded doctoral training program at the University of Nottingham and a BSc in Psychology with Cognitive Neuroscience at the University of Leicester. In my doctoral work, supervised by Dr Jasper Robinson, I focused on the associative account of human recognition memory. During the course of my training, I have visited the lab of Dr. Nancy Carlisle (Carlisle Attention and Memory Lab, Lehigh University) where we investigated an interplay between working memory and attention. Prior to that, I worked as an RA at the Centre for Systems Neuroscience (University of Leicester), where, together with Dr Joaquin Navajas we focused on visual attention and awareness.

Research interest:
* Learning and memory
* Attention and Working Memory
* Computational cognitive neuroscience
* Neural correlates of consciousness
* Functional and structural imaging
