PhD student at the Institute of Psychology, Doctoral School in the Social Sciences, Jagiellonian University.

I am a psychologist and neurobiologist, passionate about psychotherapy (especially the psychodynamic approach), sexology, clinical psychology and broadly defined neuroscience and its relations to human functioning. In my doctoral project, based on the Research Domain Criteria paradigm, I seek an in-depth understanding of the neurobiological basis of auditory hallucinations. In addition to the research, I also work clinically with patients with various mental disorders.

Research interests:
* psychiatric disorders
* dissociation and trauma experience
* sexuality and its disorders
* electroencephalography
