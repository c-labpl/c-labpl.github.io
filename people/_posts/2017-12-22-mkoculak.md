PhD student at the Institute of Psychology, Jagiellonian University.

In my Ph.D. I want to focus on using BCI (Brain-Computer Interface) methodology for consciousness research. Predominantly I work with neuroimaging data (EEG, fMRI) but I am always eager to learn new methods and approaches. Self-taught python user, also using R or Matlab if needed. Apart from studying consciousness, I enjoy learning about math, cosmology and visualization. But for the most part it's brains.

Research interests:
* searching for NCC
* data analysis
* neuroimaging
* scientific programming
* statistics
