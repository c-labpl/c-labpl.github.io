Post-doc at the Institute of Psychology, Jagiellonian University.

The main goal of my current research is to investigate how sensory substitution devices shape subjective content of perceptual experience. Iâ€™m especially interested in phenomenology of experience during spatial representation and object recognition and enactive approach applied to studies on sensory substitution.

Research interests:
* sensory substitution
* subjective measures of consciousness
* spatial representation
* phenomenological, enactive & sensorimotor approaches
* philosophy of mind & cognitive science
* higher-order theories of consciousness
