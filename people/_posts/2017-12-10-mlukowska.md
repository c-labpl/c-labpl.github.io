Doctor of Social Sciences, graduated from the Institute of Psychology, Jagiellonian University.

My research concerns perception of own body location in space. In order to investigate the problem of embodiment I use distal-to-tactile sensory substitution device (Enactive Torch), rubber-hand illusion paradigm and virtual roller coaster simulations.

Research interests:
* embodiment
* spatial navigation
* sensory substitution
* virtual reality
