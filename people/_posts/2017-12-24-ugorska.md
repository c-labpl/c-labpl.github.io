PhD candidate at Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour, Nijmegen, The Netherlands and at the Institute of Psychology, Jagiellonian University.

My scientific interests concentrate on consciousness and auditory domain. The main goal of my PhD research is an attempt to establish a method of diagnosing consciousness after severe brain injuries (e.g. vegetative state patients). I'm doing electrophysiology research on human (awake and asleep) and I test similar approaches on mice. 

Research interests:
– different states of consciousness
– sleep
– auditory cortex
