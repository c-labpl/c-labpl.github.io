PhD student at Cardiff University Brain Research Imaging Centre (CUBRIC)

My ongoing collaboration with C-Lab focuses on investigating how vision can be influenced by information from other senses. In our research we use novel stimuli and combine different indicators of conscious experience: eye movements and participants’ responses. Apart from that, I am mainly interested in the role of top-down processes in visual perception. My current research aims to answer the question of how they contribute to control of eye movements in natural scenes viewing.

Research interests:
* top-down influences on visual perception
* binocular rivalry
* visual salience
* objective measures of consciousness
