MSc Neurocognitive Psychology graduate from Carl-von-Ossietzky University, Oldenburg, MA student in Philosophy.

My main research interest is understanding consciousness and human will in the realm of computational cognitive neuroscience. After having been concerned with the sense of agency and the sense of ownership using EEG based BCI, I am now dealing with information theoretic as well as predicitive processing frameworks of consciousness.

Research interests:
* computational modeling
* integrated information predictive processing
* causality
* decision-making
* philosophy of mind
