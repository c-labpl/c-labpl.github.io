M. Sc. student at the Institute of Psychology, Carl-von-Ossietzky University of Oldenburg, Germany.

My main research interest is, broadly speaking, to understand human will, as well as its interconnection to (un)conscious states. After having been concerned with embodiment and the sense of ownership in the context of the rubber hand paradigm, I am now dealing with the sense of agency using an anthropomorphic robotic hand, investigating its phenomenal incorporability, too. I am generally fascinated by the question of how to build a bridge between mind and brain qualities.

Research interests:
– sense of agency
– sense of ownership
– intentional binding
– decision-making
– philosophy of psychology & mind
