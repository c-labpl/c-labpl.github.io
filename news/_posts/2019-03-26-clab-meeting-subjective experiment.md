We would like to invite you on the next C-lab meeting on  Monday 8th of April at 13:15, in the room 4.01 at 6 Ingardena Street. The invited speaker is Lucjan Janowski from AGH University of Science and Technology. The abstract of the presentation is below.


**"Subjective Experiment: Different Subjects"**


Subjective experiment is a typical tool to collect user opinion about a service using telecommunication network. Subjective experiments are used for different services making it especially important to understand how to design correct subjective experiment. Right now we observe specific problems with subjective experiments, which limit the obtained results. The future research have to address the problem of describing the judgement process and making correct changes to the subjective experiment design so the obtained answers are more stable, comparable and meaning full.
