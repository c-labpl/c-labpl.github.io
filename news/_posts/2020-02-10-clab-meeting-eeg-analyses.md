We would like to invite you on the next C-lab meeting on Monday, 10th of February at 13:15 in the room 5.01. It will be a second meeting with researchers from AGH University of Science and Technology, where C-Lab members will present their ongoing and planned EEG research. We will then discuss possible form of collaboration between our groups.
