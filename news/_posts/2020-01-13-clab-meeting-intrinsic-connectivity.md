We would like to invite you on the next C-lab meeting on Monday, 13th of January at 12:00 in the room 5.01. The invited speaker is dr Katarzyna Jurewicz with the presentation titled "Intrinsic connectivity networks of the brain and the case of object-based attention". The abstract of the presentation is below.


**Intrinsic connectivity networks of the brain and the case of object-based attention**

Intrinsic connectivity networks have been shown to constitute major units of functional organisation of the human brain. Studies of visual attention commonly refer to two mechanisms involved in attention allocation - one related to "top-down", volitional control and the second ("stimulus-driven"), related to reorienting towards distinctive, relevant stimuli appearing in the environment. It is also accepted that these mechanisms are supported by two separate brain networks: dorsal attention network (DAN) for directing and maintaining focus of attention and ventral attentional network (VAN) for attentional updating. In my research I wanted to verify, if the same networks underlie non-spatial reorienting of attention. To this end, an experimental paradigm was modelled on the original Posner task, but cued category of the object, instead of its location. Task-evoked activations were evaluated with reference to the main large-scale brain networks, recreated from resting-state activity of individuals.
