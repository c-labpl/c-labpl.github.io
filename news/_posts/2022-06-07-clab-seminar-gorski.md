On Monday 7th of June we will have a C-Lab seminar with dr Tomasz Górski.

**Title**
From the dynamics of neural circuits to the states of consciousness.

**Abstract**
The key questions addressed:  
How CAdEx neuronal model with conductance-based adaptation works? [1]  
How to model slow-wave neural dynamics occuring in a deep sleep or in anesthesia with neuronal models with adaptation? [2,3]  
How cholinergic stimulation alters slow-wave dynamics? [2]  
How to think about modelling conscious states?  
Some questions beyond...
