We would like to invite you on the next C-lab meeting on Wednesday, 9th of January at 13:15 (the room will be announced later). The invited speaker is prof. Daniel Margulies with the presentation titled "Topographic principles of human cortical connectivity". The abstract of the presentation is below.


**Topographic principles of human cortical connectivity**

What determines the spatial arrangement of distinct areas of the cerebral cortex? Insights into functional processing streams indicate that areas are arranged stepwise, such that adjacent spatial position along the cortical mantle represents functional gradients. Having been largely restricted to describing processing within specific sensory modalities, how do these principles generalize across modalities and extend to the surrounding association cortex? I will present recent work describing various features of a principal gradient in cortical connectivity that spans between primary sensory/motor areas and higher-order transmodal association regions that in humans are known as the default-mode network. This arrangement suggests developmental mechanisms giving rise to the spatial distribution of cortical functions, and provides an anatomical scaffolding for investigating the propagation of information at both local and distributed spatial scales.
