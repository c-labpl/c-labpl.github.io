On Monday 30th of May we will have a C-Lab seminar with dr Marta Siedlecka.

**Title**  
What does a person do after feedback? An empirical study and a struggle for a different way of doing research.

**Abstract**  
During the talk I will present the results of a study aimed to test the causal effect of feedback on immediate metacognitive and cognitive performance. Presenting this study will be an opportunity to present my struggles to do better research and the small steps Iâ€™ve taken on this journey. This new way of doing psychological science starts with the belief that apart from preregistration and data-related transparency we need transparent goals and explicitly stated assumptions; instead of more data we need more conceptual analyses; and instead of producing new effects, we should produce data that allow us to make justified inference.
