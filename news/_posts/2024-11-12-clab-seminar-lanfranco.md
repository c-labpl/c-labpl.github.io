On Tuesday, the 12th of November at 10:00 we will have a C-Lab seminar with [Dr Renzo Lanfranco](https://www.renzolanfranco.com/) from Karolinska Institutet, Sweden.
The meeting will take place in the Institute of Psychology on Ingardena Street 6, room 2.15.

**Title**  
Teasing apart perceptual processing and conscious access in face processing and body ownership using psychophysics, computational modelling, multivariate decoding, and information-theory metrics

**Abstract**  
The human brain is finely tuned to both visual and body-related information, enabling us to distinguish accurately whether sensory inputs arise from the external environment or within our own bodies, and create a subjective experience about them. In this talk, I will discuss foundational methods in visual perception and body ownership research, addressing their common limitations for addressing fundamental questions in consciousness research, and highlighting recent advancements designed to overcome these challenges. Specifically, I will explore signal detection theory for analysing conscious perception, Bayesian hierarchical modelling of conscious access, and drift-diffusion modelling for tracking evidence accumulation for perception and awareness. Additionally, I will examine how these behavioural metrics, combined with multivariate decoding and information-theoretic approaches, can help pinpoint the neural signatures underlying conscious experience in a bias-free manner.
