On Wednesday 23th of November we will have a C-Lab seminar with Daniel Gut from AGH University of Science and Technology.

**Title**  
Artificial intelligence in the service of medical imaging diagnostics.

**Abstract**  
Deep neural networks are increasingly used in more and more fields and one of such areas is widely understood medical diagnostics. Despite the efforts made to increase the availability of medical imaging (CT, MRI) in medical treatment, the waiting time for a description of images is often several weeks. For the patient, this means waiting for treatment to be introduced or adjusted, during which time the clinical condition may change. Deep learning models can come to the rescue here by providing significant support for radiologists, accelerating their work and increasing the accuracy of diagnoses. In my presentation Iâ€™m willing to say a few words about current status of the research in that field and what blocks us from faster development of artificial intelligence algorithms for medical applications.
