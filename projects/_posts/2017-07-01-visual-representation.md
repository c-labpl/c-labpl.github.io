In this project we are investigating what is the relationship between memory precision and subjective visibility (or accessibility)  in visual working memory. More specifically, are these two parameters based on the same type of information? Does subjective visibility add to predictions regarding visual working memory performance?

In this project we are investigating what is the relationship between memory precision and subjective visibility (or accessibility)  in visual working memory.

We believe this topic is important for both working memory and consciousness theories. On one hand it may provide some evidence regarding the role of our subjective visibility of memory performance and contrast it with objectively measured memory precision. On the other hand, data acquired throughout the project may inform consciousness theories, such as Partial Awareness Theory or dissociative theories (e.g. Phenomenal & Access consciousness) about the extent of subjective visibility as compared with objectively measured perceptual precision.
