This project is motivated by the lack of reliable clinical methods to differentiate patients after severe brain injuries classified as prolonged disorders of consciousness (PDOC). Its main assumption is that the perception of complex auditory textures requires the brain to detect certain statistical pattern and integrate statistical information which can only occur in the presence of consciousness. An essential goal of this project is comprehensive test of its hypotheses on a group of healthy subjects in awake and asleep condition, on PDOC patients as well as on mice during direct registration of neuronal responses in the auditory cortex where manipulation with the level of consciousness is obtained with anesthesia.
